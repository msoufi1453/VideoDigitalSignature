# VideoDigitalSignature

As deepfakes become more and more common online, I made this tool for people to create their own digital signature that they could embed. So long as their private key isn't known by others, they can trust that only videos can have their digital signature.
Using Discrete Cosine Transform, we can embed and recover information from each frame of the video and make information more robust to cropping, changes in video quality, and other distortions that can happen as a video gets reused and sent across the internet
